        'MERRA-2',
        'The Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) provides data beginning in 1980 at a spatial resolution of 0.625° × 0.5°. In comparison with the original MERRA dataset, MERRA-2 represents the advances made in both the Goddard Earth Observing System Model, Version 5 (GEOS- 5) and the Global Statistical Interpolation (GSI) assimilation system that enable assimilation of modern hyperspectral radiance and microwave observations, along with GPS-Radio Occultation datasets. MERRA-2 is the first long-term global reanalysis to assimilate space- based observations of aerosols and represent their interactions with other physical processes in the climate system.',

        'ERA5',
        'ERA5 is the fifth generation of ECMWF atmospheric reanalyses and provides hourly estimates of a large number of global atmospheric, land and oceanic climate variables from 1979 to present. The data cover the Earth on a 30km grid (0.25º of the operational model) and resolve the atmosphere using 137 levels from the surface up to a height of 80km, with additional information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions. ERA5 combines vast amounts of historical observations into global estimates using advanced modelling (CY41r2 of ECMWF''s Integrated Forecast System) and data assimilation (ten member 4D-Var ensemble) systems. Improvements to ERA5, compared to ERA-Interim, include use of HadISST.2, reprocessed ECMWF climate data records (CDR), and implementation of RTTOV11 radiative transfer. Variational bias corrections have not only been applied to satellite radiances, but also ozone retrievals, aircraft observations, surface pressure, and radiosonde profiles.',

        'NARR',
        'The NCEP North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) is a high-resolution (32 km) data set focused upon the North American domain and spanning from 1979 to near present. The NARR uses the high resolution NCEP Eta Model (32km/45 layer) together with the Regional Data Assimilation System (RDAS) which directly assimilates observed precipitation along with other variables. Relative to the NCEP-DOE Global Reanalysis 2, it has a much improved land-hydrology, diurnal cycle and land-atmosphere interaction.',
