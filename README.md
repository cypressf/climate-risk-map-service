## Configure

Copy `.env.template` to `.env` and replace values with your own, or set them as environment variables. Environment variables overwrite anything in the `.env` file. The `.env` file is an optional convenience mostly for dev builds.

## Build and run

Install [rust and cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html)

`cargo run` to run a dev build

`cargo run --release` to run a release build
